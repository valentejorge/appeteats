I followed Flask's factory architecture [(see more in documentation)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/patterns/appfactories/) so I modularized my project, because after working on it a little and seeing that there were already too many lines and I couldn't find it, it became very difficult to make any progress, as I would first need to understand where things were and then implement a new functionality.

So I searched a lot for how to format in the best way, always trying to apply good practices (most of the time), I learned a lot about architecture and design patterns, [(this video helped me a lot with that, thank you Bruno Rocha)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qWySnuoaTM), and after modularizing you can notice that inside the module there are 5 directories: extensions, routes, statics, tests, models and in the root you can find the canonical flask files such as app.py, requirements.py...

### Extensions (/ext)
In the ext dir we can find the:

- `comands.py` as responsible for flask commands, such create, restart and drop database, and populate database from a json file.

- `configuration.py` as responsible for configure the application using the [FlaskDynaConf](https://www.dynaconf.com/flask/)

- `error.py` as responsible for configure the error page with a [Custom Error Page](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/errorhandling/)

- `socketio.py` as responsible for configure the webhooks and rooms using [Flask SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#rooms)

- `sesssions.py` as responsible for configure the sessions

- `/helpers` initialy was a unique file call `helper.py` but, because the i needed more help, it became a dir with multiple files inside divided by domain, so inside of `/helpers` we can find:

 - `cache_images.py` as responsible for verify if image exists in cache, and create the cache of image if not exists

 - `db_tools.py` as responsible for provide tools for manipulate database and make more easy and reusable many commands of database

 - `format_data.py` as responsible for format the data from database, is very usefull and makes it easier to know if the restaurant is open

 - `get_inputs.py` as responsible for provide tools for get inputs from user and make more easy and reusable many functions for get data

 - `register_tools.py` as responsible for
